# Objectives
-Flash ESP32 with Micropython
-Setup 400v voltage output to count radioactivity from SBM-20 with 4.5M MÎ© series resistor
-Measures radioactive gamma and beta and alpha radiation with quite good resolution
-use of shields to detect particles
-use of ULTRASONIC SENSOR to detect location of the sample
-Collcet the data from the serial and then add them to a list of array by using python script
-Use of MQTTClient to pass the observed data to network
-Use of Node-RED to programe for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
-plot live data and post processing the data in ParaView
